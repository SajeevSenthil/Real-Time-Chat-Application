# Real-Time-Chat-Application
A simple chat application that allows users to communicate in real time, share media files, and send private messages within a group using *\username*. Private messages are visible only to the sender and the specified recipient. The application features a basic UI with a gradient background for a stress-free chat environment.

# Features
1) **Real-time Messaging:** Exchange messages instantly with other users in the chat.
2) **Private Messaging:** Send messages privately to specific users using *\username* (e.g., \John Hello).
3) **Media Sharing:** Share files with other users in the chat.
4) **User-Friendly UI:** Minimalistic and responsive interface.
5) **Color-coded Messages:** Each user is assigned a unique message color.

# Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1) Node.js (v14 or higher)
2) npm (comes with Node.js)

# Project Structure
